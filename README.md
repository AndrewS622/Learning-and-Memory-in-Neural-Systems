# Learning-and-Memory-in-Neural-Systems
ES 226R at Harvard University

This graduate-level course in neural engineering examined the fundamentals of learning in neural systems from biological and computational perspectives. The content of two problem sets are contained in this repository, which cover the following topics: 

1. The Full Hodgkin-Huxley Model and a State-Space Representation Through Dynamical Systems Analysis
2. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms to Solve a Maze, The Mountain-Car Problem, and a Model of Memory Consolidation in the Medial Temporal Lobe
